Care should be taken when comparing with other inventories because different authors use different mapping techniques. This inventory includes landslides triggered by a sequence of earthquakes rather than a single mainshock. Please check the author methods summary and the original data source for more information on these details and to confirm the viability of this inventory for your specific use.   With the exception of the data from USGS sources, the inventory data and associated metadata were not acquired by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and thus have not been reviewed for accuracy and completeness by the USGS.  They are presented as part of this data series for convenience of the user only, as part of an effort to make published ground-failure inventories more accessible from a single aggregated site.
